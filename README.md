website for UC Denver Grad Algorithms class, Fall 2015

>>Briefly, I need a password protected page with one username and password for everybody, a subpage for homework assignments, another for Mathematica notebooks, and another for links to the news articles. And one with email addresses of everybody. I’ll link your page to the syllabus as per usual. There is extra credit for the student webpage in terms of your final grade— I’ll give you a boost to the next highest grade (for example and A- would become an A). You can either host the webpage or else we have one in the department through Dat.

>>Most of the work is in the set-up of the page and after that, you’ll hear from me when there is an announcement or assignment or Mathematica lab to post and then I’ll ask you to inform everyone once the new material is available.
